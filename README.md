rest-confidence
===============

This is a uber-simple yet powerful-enough configuration server.

Tired of configuring many components in many different environments? rest-confidence helps you centralize your configuration and expose it as a REST service.

Other use cases include using it as a service directory or as a foundation for A/B testing. 

It uses [confidence](https://github.com/spumko/confidence), with all it niceties now remotelly accesible using a simple REST service.
